{"name":"Wurfelengine","tagline":"An isometric game engine for games with a world made of blocks (like Minecraft). For RPGs, action, strategy, puzzle or adventure games.","body":"Wurfelengine\r\n============\r\n\r\nWurfelengine is a 2.5D isometric Java game engine build with Slick (soon: libgdx).\r\nThe name comes from the german word for cube (WÃ¼rfel).\r\n\r\n![Wurfelengine logo](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1787847/870933/750c2e70-f83a-11e2-8de3-4c19958e1801.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Goal\r\n\r\n1. Provide a normal open source game engine because open source games are always geek games (often in ASCII)\r\n2. An easy engine for strategy or adventure games\r\n3. Minecraft is hip, so are blocks.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n    Open Source:\r\n        Well commented\r\n        Clean code: no geeky code with strange indent and names\r\n        No licensing costs\r\n    Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)\r\n    Map Streaming: make maps as big as you want like in Minecraft\r\n    Three Dimensions: make maps with high buildings or deep dungeons\r\n    Map editor: free & included\r\n    Fast: Wurfelengine renders only what is visible \r\n    Easy: look at our examples (soon) how easy it is to build a small game\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit the official website:\r\nhttp://www.wurfelengine.net\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
